# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a thumbnail preview of the last captured screenshot to the AI Screen Assistant interface. The thumbnail will be displayed above the AI output text box, allowing users to see what screenshot the AI is analyzing. Users can click the thumbnail to view a full-size version in a separate window with an easy-to-use close button.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a thumbnail of my last screenshot above the AI output, so that I can quickly reference what the AI is analyzing without having to remember what I captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a screenshot is captured and sent for AI analysis THEN the system SHALL display a thumbnail version of the screenshot above the AI output text box
2. WHEN a new screenshot is captured THEN the system SHALL replace the previous thumbnail with the new screenshot thumbnail
3. WHEN the application starts with no screenshots taken THEN the system SHALL show no thumbnail in the preview area
4. WHEN a screenshot analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the thumbnail of the screenshot being analyzed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on the thumbnail to see the full-size screenshot, so that I can examine details that might not be visible in the small thumbnail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the thumbnail THEN the system SHALL open a new window displaying the full-size screenshot
2. WHEN the full-size screenshot window opens THEN the system SHALL display the image at an appropriate size for viewing (up to 1080p resolution)
3. WHEN the full-size screenshot window is open THEN the system SHALL maintain the main application window functionality
4. WHEN the user interacts with the main window while the screenshot window is open THEN both windows SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an easy way to close the full-size screenshot window, so that I can quickly return to using the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full-size screenshot window is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a clearly visible close button
2. WHEN the user clicks the close button THEN the system SHALL close the screenshot window and return focus to the main application
3. WHEN the user presses the Escape key in the screenshot window THEN the system SHALL close the screenshot window
4. WHEN the user clicks the window's standard close button (X) THEN the system SHALL close the screenshot window

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the thumbnail to be appropriately sized and positioned, so that it doesn't interfere with the main interface while still being useful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the thumbnail is displayed THEN the system SHALL size it to be clearly visible but not dominate the interface
2. WHEN the thumbnail is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it above the AI output text box
3. WHEN the main window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate thumbnail positioning and sizing
4. WHEN the thumbnail is displayed THEN the system SHALL preserve the aspect ratio of the original screenshot
